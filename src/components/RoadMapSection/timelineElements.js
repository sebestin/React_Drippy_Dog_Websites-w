(Every doge lover that is holding a doge down the road will get a companion NFT for free) The rest of the fate of this project will be determined by YOU, the community! Together, we plan to make this an ultra strong, fun loving, community! Let’s kick some butt! 🐶Finally, there is a lot being discussed about potential partnerships and future developments of the project. Our focus for the time being is having a super smooth launch and delivering on everything listed above. We don’t think it is fair to over hype things for now that aren’t set in stone.",
